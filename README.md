# Cloudflare + Lit Protocol integration (Video Library)
This is a demo website for Cloudflare + Lit Protocol integration. This is a simple video library website where everyone can upload videos.
In order to watch the videos, users need to request presigned urls from the API, but not all users can request them.  
The presigned urls are limited to those who have authorization (using Lit Protocol dynamic content).
